Please disregard the parenthesis that start and stop the examples I give you for correct notation. They are placed there to stop the markdown file from displaying it and so you can see the correct notation without markdown processing it. 

A (#) in a markdown file makes a header. See Below.

# This has one pound sign

The amount of (#) you have makes the text smaller. Below has different amounts of # to show an example of what happens. 

## This has two pound signs
#### This has four pound signs 


Brackets link to an external link in a Markdown File. This is the correct notation: ([name of link](this is where the link goes)

[Github](https://github.com)

You can also do this for another file on your github. The link below links to the other markdown file in my repository. This is the notation: ([what you want to name file](actual name of file)

[testfile](test.md)

You can link to an image using (![image](this is where the name of the picture goes). As long as the picture is included in your github files it will load the picture perfectly. 

![image](Unknown.jpeg)

This is how you can also link to an image. You can put ([Image](then the link goes in here of the image])

The following is an example of syntax coding. You start with three grave accent signs, then put your code in the middle then end it with 3 acute accent signs. 

```javascript
var a = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(a);
```

The following is a blockquote. You can do this by putting a (>) in the front then saying your message after the sign. 
> I have never used a block quote before
