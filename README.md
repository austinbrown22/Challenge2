# Markdown Tutorial

### By: Austin Brown

This is a tutorial about markdown, it covers everything a student would need to know if they took IT 2600 plus a little more. I think this is a great tutorial because it explains how to do it then provides an example to show the audience how it should look in the end.

The target audience of this tutorial would be anyone in IT 2600 or just anyone that wants to expand their knowledge of markdown and become familiar with it. The level of prior knowledge this tutorial would suit is someone that has no experience in markdown. 


I decided to do markdown as my tutorial because it is the one challenge I struggled with at first because it was hard to find anything on the internet that showed how to do it as well as gave an example. I think this will really help students. 

Here is the link to the tutorial:
