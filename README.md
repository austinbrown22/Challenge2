# Markdown Tutorial

### By: Austin Brown

This is a tutorial about markdown, it covers everything a student would need to know if they took IT 2600 plus a little more. I think this is a great tutorial because it explains how to do it then provides an example to show the audience how it should look in the end.

The target audience of this tutorial would be anyone in IT 2600 or just anyone that wants to expand their knowledge of markdown and become familiar with it. The level of prior knowledge this tutorial would suit is someone that has no experience in markdown.
